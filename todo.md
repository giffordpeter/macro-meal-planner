# Macro Meal Planner - Tasks

## üî• Current Priority: Infrastructure Separation

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (2-3 days)
1. Backend Infrastructure
   - [ ] Create Terraform configurations for:
     - [ ] VPC and networking
     - [ ] Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL
     - [ ] ECS Fargate cluster
     - [ ] API Gateway
   - [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring
   - [ ] Configure security groups and IAM roles

2. Frontend Preparation
   - [ ] Update Next.js configuration for API endpoints
   - [ ] Modify environment variable handling
   - [ ] Update build scripts

### Phase 2: Backend Migration (2-3 days)
1. Database
   - [ ] Set up Aurora Serverless staging instance
   - [ ] Create database migration scripts
   - [ ] Test data migration process
   - [ ] Configure automated backups

2. API Layer
   - [ ] Deploy Prisma service to ECS
   - [ ] Set up application load balancer
   - [ ] Configure auto-scaling
   - [ ] Implement health checks

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates (1-2 days)
1. Environment Updates
   - [ ] Create staging environment
   - [ ] Update API endpoints
   - [ ] Test with new backend
   - [ ] Configure preview deployments

2. Build Process
   - [ ] Remove backend build steps
   - [ ] Update environment variable loading
   - [ ] Optimize build caching

### Phase 4: CI/CD and Testing (2-3 days)
1. Backend Pipeline
   - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure staging deployment
   - [ ] Set up production approval process
   - [ ] Implement automated testing

2. Frontend Pipeline
   - [ ] Update Amplify build settings
   - [ ] Configure branch-based deployments
   - [ ] Set up end-to-end testing

## üìä Monitoring & Security

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboards for:
  - [ ] API metrics
  - [ ] Database metrics
  - [ ] Cost tracking
- [ ] Configure critical alerts
- [ ] Set up error notifications

### Security
- [ ] Implement VPC security best practices
- [ ] Update Auth0/NextAuth configuration
- [ ] Configure CORS policies
- [ ] Set up WAF rules

## üìù Documentation

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Infrastructure architecture diagram
- [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Environment setup guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### Operations Documentation
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting procedures
- [ ] Incident response playbook
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## üí∞ Cost Management
- [ ] Set up cost allocation tags
- [ ] Configure budget alerts
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization

## Success Metrics
- Zero downtime during migration
- Improved deployment speed (<10 minutes)
- Reduced build times
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities
- Separate staging/prod environments

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Data Migration**
   - Risk: Data loss
   - Mitigation: Multiple backups, test migrations

2. **Service Disruption**
   - Risk: Deployment downtime
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment

3. **Cost Control**
   - Risk: Unexpected AWS costs
   - Mitigation: Budget alerts, resource optimization
