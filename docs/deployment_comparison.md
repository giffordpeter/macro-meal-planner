- More complex monitoring configuration

## Recommendation

For the Macro Meal Planner project, I recommend **staying with AWS Amplify** for the following reasons:

1. **Project Scale**:
   - Our application is a medium-sized Next.js app
   - We don't need complex deployment orchestration
   - Amplify's simplicity matches our needs

2. **Development Speed**:
   - Amplify's built-in Next.js support saves setup time
   - Automatic branch deployments aid development
   - Simple environment management

3. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Amplify's pricing model is more cost-effective for our scale
   - Fewer services to manage and pay for
   - Includes CDN and SSL at no extra cost

4. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Less infrastructure to maintain
   - Simpler deployment process
   - Built-in SSL and domain management

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Fix current Amplify deployment issues
   - Implement better error handling
   - Add deployment notifications
   - Set up proper environment variables

2. **Future Considerations**:
   - Monitor application growth
   - Evaluate CodePipeline if we need:
     - More complex deployment orchestration
     - Custom build processes
     - Advanced rollback strategies
   - Consider hybrid approach using Amplify for hosting and CodePipeline for CI/CD

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Deployment Issues**:
   - Implement better logging
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms
   - Create deployment checklist

2. **Scalability**:
   - Monitor build times
   - Track deployment frequency
   - Document pain points

3. **Costs**:
   - Monitor build minutes
   - Optimize build process
   - Set up cost alerts
